Stock Price Prediction Model (LSTM)
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to analyze stock market data and predict future closing prices. This model can be used to forecast future stock price movements based on historical data.

Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

numpy

pandas

yfinance

sklearn

tensorflow

matplotlib

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
pip install numpy pandas yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Project Steps
Data Collection:

The project uses the yfinance library to fetch stock data.

If the data for a specific stock cannot be fetched, alternative tickers are tried (THYAO.IS, THYAO, THYAO.BIST).

Data Cleaning:

Missing values in the data are filled using the forward fill method.

Data Preparation:

The closing prices (Close) are used as the target feature for modeling.

Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler (scaled between 0-1).

Training data is generated by using the last 60 days of stock data to predict the next day.

LSTM Model:

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based model is created.

The model consists of 2 LSTM layers and 1 Dense layer.

The model is compiled with the adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

Model Training:

The model is trained for 10 epochs.

Prediction:

The next day's closing price is predicted using the last 60 days of stock data.

Output:

The predicted closing price is displayed on the screen.

Usage
Save the project as a Python file (e.g., finance.py).

Ensure you have an active internet connection for the yfinance library to fetch stock data.

Run the script to get the stock price prediction:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
python finance.py
Sample Output
text
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
Fetching data: THYAO.IS...
âœ… Data successfully fetched: THYAO.IS
ðŸ“Š Predicted next day's closing price: 52.45 TL
Error Messages and Warnings
If data cannot be fetched, alternative tickers will be tried in sequence. If no data is obtained, the error message "Stock data could not be fetched. Please try alternative sources." will be shown, and the process will stop.

If an error occurs while fetching the data, error messages will be displayed on the screen.

Changes
Model Structure: You can modify the number of LSTM layers, units, and other hyperparameters to improve model performance.

Training Time: You can increase the number of epochs for better results.
